We are working on " An Approach to Uncover The Roots of Complex Emotions. " 

Our project aims to develop a model that can predict a given sentence's Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD: three independent and bipolar dimensions, pleasure-displeasure, degree of arousal, and dominance-submissiveness, are both necessary and sufficient to adequately define emotional states) values and use those values to predict the corresponding emotions present in the text. This method can help us better understand the emotions present in a text and improve the user experience for applications that rely on text-based interactions.


Expected Outcomes:

Our project's expected outcome is a model that can predict the complex emotions behind a given text. The output will be evaluated using human intuition and other data present in EmoBank. We expect our model to perform well and give us an accurate representation of the emotions present in the text.
